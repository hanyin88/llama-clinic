"[doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05/07/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06/29/2021 , and was discharged on 07/02/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?
[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
[patient] thanks , you too .
[doctor] next line heading will be "" acute to chronic constipation "" . she believes her hospitalization was more likely due to her dysreflexia , from her quadriplegia that typically occurs . she did have a lot of vital signs changes , including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen , including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis .
[doctor] i would recommend just in the next three or four weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs , and we'll repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells tend downward . uh , next line and heading will be "" quadriplegia "" . um , next line and heading will be "" covid vaccine status "" . again , she's hesitant . we had a good discussion , and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe that supplements are necessarily going to help stave this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid . however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

[doctor] okay so right now you're experiencing right leg pain but you have injured your your left leg before is that what i'm hearing
[patient] yeah that's fine
[doctor] alright were you able to continue playing

[doctor] i'm sorry okay so what have you been doing for the pain since then
[patient] i wrapped it after a the game they had some ace wraps in their clubhouse and so i wrapped it up and then i iced it last night and i just kept it up on a pillow and then i took some ibuprofen
[doctor] okay could you one more time when did this injury happen
[patient] this happened about couple days ago
[doctor] okay so did you say whether does the ibuprofen help at all
[patient] yeah it helps a little bit but then you know it it you know after a while it wears out
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numb numbness or tingling
[patient] no no numbness
[doctor] okay alright any loss in sensation
[patient] no i mean i i can still feel like i can still feel my foot
[doctor] okay alright that's good to hear so you were playing tennis is that what you normally do to work out
[patient] i do i'm trying to learn but i can not afford tennis less lessons so me and my friends just hit the balls back and forth i do sleep
[doctor] i love it absolutely yeah my dad one time took me to play racquet ball and i learned the very bruisy way that that was n't for me yeah
[patient] that scares me
[doctor] it's it they they move pretty fast i'm not gon na lie alright so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do my my physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my findings but if you have any questions go ahead stop me let me know but i will be explaining along the way okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery
[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc
[doctor] i know
[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[doctor] so it's actually
[patient] have to be in the hospital
[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[patient] i'm right handed
[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[patient] i mean
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[patient] i suppose so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay

[patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent
[doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time
[patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time
[doctor] okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath
[patient] no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine
[doctor] okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me
[patient] yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles
[doctor] awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited
[patient] yeah yeah i'm excited
[doctor] do you have any like plans for the holiday
[patient] no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah
[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling
[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital
[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep
[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal
[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed
[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling
[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital
[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep
[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal
[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed
[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

"[doctor] alright teresa i see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain could you tell me where it hurts

[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and when i i i've been doing some pottery i've been creating you know i have a pottery wheel and i've been i love my pottery and for my son's birthday i've been making a a ceramic bowl and i'm gon na paint it and i have to do some real full decorations but i've really been working on it a lot and my gosh this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much
[doctor] i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything
[patient] yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm
[doctor] okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything
[patient] no not that i recall
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain
[patient] well i'd say it's about a seven
[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night
[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else
[patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
[doctor] okay
[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly
[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties
[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly
[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay

[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright no problem any other questions
[patient] nope

"[doctor] alright you can go ahead
[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so
[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better
[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started
[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of
[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that
[doctor] no nothing at all
[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that
[doctor] no
[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before
[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help
[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
[doctor] alright
[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
[doctor] no numbness or tingling
[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
[doctor] okay
[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
[doctor] yeah
[patient] acromioclavicular joints
[doctor] yeah yeah
[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
[doctor] yes thank you yep
[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
[doctor] i have n't
[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days

"[doctor] amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .
[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?
[patient] yes , on february 9th .
[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
The patient is a 72-year-old female who presents for follow-up for hypertension. Her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mild hypercholesterolemia. At last visit on April 16th, her blood pressure was 130/90. After presenting at 150/100, she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily, and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily. CMP and CBC were essentially unremarkable. The patient reports that she has struggled with not drinking alcohol and has been drinking for a while (four or five times a week). She feels that stopping alcohol would be helpful for her hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medications, including lisinopril half doses due to feeling lethargic and tired with the full dose. She also takes hydrochlorothiazide at full dose. She experiences no chest tightness, pressure, or shortness of breath. She monitors her blood pressure at home and sees lower numbers in the morning compared to the evening.","SUBJECTIVE

"[doctor] amanda taylor , birth date october 31st 1949 . patient is a 72 year old woman who comes for followup for hypertension . her history includes significant alcohol use disorder and mi- mild hypercholesterolemia . at last visit on april 16th her blood pressure was 130 over 90 . after presenting at 150 over 100 she was prescribed hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams by mouth once daily , and lisinopril 20 milligrams by mouth once daily . cmp and cbc were essentially unremarkable .
[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?
[patient] yes , on february 9th .
[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .

"[doctor] brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl .
[doctor] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome , and have a good rest of your day .
[doctor] so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan . brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications , as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 milligrams at bedtime for ibs .
[doctor] she can use bentyl 20 milligrams as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed . however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in one month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects and issues , or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?

"[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?

"[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .

"[doctor] donna torres , date of birth , 08/01/1980 .
[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .

[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .

[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions

[patient] yes i've been taking it everyday
[doctor] okay and how about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods
[patient] i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that

[patient] yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after
[doctor] after that okay and how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister how is everyone going

[patient] no
[doctor] no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here
[patient] maybe a little bit just a little bit

[doctor] okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay

[doctor] okay and how about your diet how's been thing as far as salty foods
[patient] i've been trying to stay away from the salty foods but sugar intake i'm having a little bit of trouble with that
[doctor] okay okay but it seems like you've been making good progress and that could be difficult sometimes and you mentioned being around i think you said your sister a few days ago or a family member
[patient] yeah she was just kinda sick with similar symptoms and i noticed i started to developed a little bit of a cough right after
[doctor] after that okay and how is your family doing how is everyone doing other than that other than being sick for your sister how is everyone going
[patient] everyone's doing great
[doctor] okay
[patient] working busy with life yeah
[doctor] okay and for you too were you on vacation last week and a lot of people had vacation last week
[patient] yes i was on vacation last week actually
[doctor] okay hopefully you were n't sick for too much of it
[patient] no i was feeling okay
[doctor] okay okay
[patient] got back and started feeling poorly
[doctor] sorry about that alright so what i'm gon na do now is i'm gon na go ahead and start your physical exam i looking at your vitals vitals look overall pretty good i do see your blood pressure is elevated at here it's one forty four over seventy two otherwise everything else looks good so let's check you out so first starting i'm just gon na check start with your sinuses and when i press here do you have any pain any tenderness when i do that
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay so no frontal sinus tenderness how about when i press on the on your cheeks here
[patient] maybe a little bit just a little bit
[doctor] on both sides
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so bilateral maxillary sinus tenderness alright and i'm just gon na take a look at in your mouth if you can open up okay so i do see some do have some erythema of the pharynx and the tonsils are symmetrical i do n't appreciate any exudates now i'm just checking your neck and i do appreciate some anterior cervical adenopathy alright and i'm just gon na take a listen to you alright so listening to your heart so you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and you do still have that two out of six systolic ejection murmur at the left base now i'm taking listen to your lungs and on your lungs exam okay your lungs are nice and clear i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales or rhonchi alright and just looking at your lower extremities i do n't appreciate any edema there so let's talk about my assessment and plan so for your first problem of the cough so looking at your cough it does seem like you have a upper respiratory infection and so basically that's a virus most likely it's a virus that's causing your symptoms especially being around someone else who has similar symptoms and seems like most likely they spread it to you so i want you to continue with doing a lot of the time is just letting the virus run it's course and taking things just to help with your symptoms so drinking lots of fluids that's gon na help you trying i know you've been doing a cough medicine you can even try another one you have to be careful with the blood pressure and diabetes so you can try like a coricidin hbp can help with the cough and lots of rest okay lots of rest now we are in a current pandemic and so something i can check for you if you're okay with that is checking for covid if that's okay with you
[patient] yes i'm okay with that
[doctor] okay so we will check you for that today and see how you're doing with that and then we will give you those results okay any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] no okay so for problem number two the type two diabetes so we'll continue you on your metformin five hundred milligrams daily or twice a day you had blood work at your last visit so you'll be due at your next visit for your hemoglobin a1c and that's the check the sugars on your red blood cells so we do that about every three months so at your next visit we'll check that for you and then we will go from there but it seems like you're doing well with that now as far as problem number three your high blood pressure so your blood pressure is elevated here and it sounds like it's been you know creeping up just a little bit at home as well you're on a very tiny dose of the hydrochlorothiazide so what i would like to do is increase it to twenty five milligrams once a day again i would recommend that you take it in the morning just because you may have noticed it can make you urinate quite a bit and then i would love for you to just continue checking as you have been a few times a week just checking your blood pressure at different times of the day so we can continue to see how you do with that okay
[patient] okay alright that sounds
[doctor] alright any questions for me
[patient] no questions

[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying
[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain

[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile

[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile
[doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up
[patient] exactly
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before
[patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never
[doctor] okay
[patient] injured or broken a bone
[doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me
[patient] so will i be able to run again
[doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else
[patient] no i think that's it
[doctor] okay have a great day
[patient] okay you too
[doctor] thank you

[patient] go for it .
[doctor] okay , so rebecca is a 27-year-old female patient . um , you have a history of carpal tunnel , um , uh , release done couple of years ago , you have some chronic back pain , some depression . why am i seeing you today ?
[patient] so last week , um , and over the course of the month , i have taken up swimming more regularly .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've been trying to get up and get active . and i've- ... all of a sudden i've been feeling some really bad , um , knee pain-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?
[patient] yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .
[doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?
[patient] that's been going really well .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .
[doctor] sleeping well ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
[patient] that's doing-
[doctor] any flare up with that ?
[patient] . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?
[patient] yeah , go for it .
[doctor] squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts .
[doctor] okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts too .
[doctor] okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , but i think , um , i think that's been under control . but if it flares up go ahead and , uh , give me a call , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] um , your third problem is your depression . that's been stable . we're gon na keep you on your current medication , not gon na change anything at this point , okay ? and as far as your carpal tunnel goes , that's relatively stable , so , um , uh , no changes there as well . okay ? so anything else i can do for you ?
[patient] no , that's it .
[doctor] okay , well we'll get you checked out .
[patient] all right .

[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your second problem is your chronic back pain , that's been doing really well . um , keep swimming , that's okay after this gets better .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , but i think , um , i think that's been under control . but if it flares up go ahead and , uh , give me a call , okay ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] um , your third problem is your depression . that's been stable . we're gon na keep you on your current medication , not gon na change anything at this point , okay ? and as far as your carpal tunnel goes , that's relatively stable , so , um , uh , no changes there as well . okay ? so anything else i can do for you ?
[patient] no , that's it .
[doctor] okay , well we'll get you checked out .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] hey dragon , finalize the report .

[patient] i'm good how are you
[doctor] i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today
[patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath
[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs
[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk
[doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have
[patient] i have a dobrman
[doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm
[patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm
[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever
[patient] no fever
[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain
[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful
[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay
[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks

[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay
[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so do you have any questions for me
[patient] no

[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having for a few weeks now
[doctor] wow well i'm sorry to hear that do you remember what you were doing when the pain started
[patient] i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that
[doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything
[patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do n't remember hitting it either
[doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder
[patient] it is
[doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me
[patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts
[doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go
[patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there
[doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all
[patient] i ca n't
[doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side
[patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up
[doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] okay
[patient] and it does help take the edge off
[doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level
[patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three
[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that
[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift
[patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work
[doctor] nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here
[patient] no
[doctor] yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot
[patient] i definitely will check that out
[doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
[patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away
[doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do
[patient] okay alright
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks

[patient] i you know i ca n't think about anything specifically but i am very active and i also have been renovating my basement so i have been doing a lot with that
[doctor] wow okay and do you know if there was any direct or associated trauma that you can think of over the past three weeks like did you fall or hit your shoulder or anything
[patient] no no trauma that i can think of at all
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do n't remember hitting it either
[doctor] okay now have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i'm active and will have aches and pains here and there but nothing that some tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay and and it's isolated to your left shoulder
[patient] it is
[doctor] okay are you able to move that left arm for me
[patient] you know anytime i try reaching for something or lifting anything i have a lot of pain and i do n't even try to raise my arm over my head because that's it it really hurts
[doctor] okay so now i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain are you having pain all of the time or does it wax and wane does it come and go
[patient] it's all the time and if there is any pressure like when i try to sleep at night i ca n't even lay i'm a side sleeper and it i really gives me a hard time because i'm so uncomfortable so the pain is always there
[doctor] okay so you ca n't lay on your left side at all
[patient] i ca n't
[doctor] alright now do you have that pain when you lay on your back as well or just on your left side
[patient] i mean it's always there but when i sleep directly on it the pain goes up
[doctor] okay now let's talk just briefly about your pain so if you have n't taken anything at all or have you been taking anything at all let's start with that have you been taking anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol and i'll take two extra strengths tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] okay
[patient] and it does help take the edge off
[doctor] okay that's good now without any tylenol what's your pain level
[patient] without any tylenol i would say my pain is like a three
[doctor] okay and then with tylenol with that
[patient] i'm sorry i keep doing that without any tylenol my pain is like a seven and with tylenol it goes down to a two or three
[doctor] okay that's good so the tylenol really does help you that that's a good thing
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so you talked about renovating your basement did you guys just move in or is it just time for a little house facelift
[patient] yeah it just time we've been living in this house for some time now and you know with the pandemic we've been home and so decided to do some work
[doctor] nice have you been into the new home depot that they just opened down the street here
[patient] no
[doctor] yeah it's nice my wife and i were there this weekend and they just opened two weeks ago so everything's fully stocked and if you guys are doing some renovations you might run down there and you know save big money at home depot
[patient] i definitely will check that out
[doctor] so are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your arm or hand
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so if you do n't mind i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam i've reviewed your vitals everything looks good there and i'm gon na do a focused exam of your left shoulder now you have limited active and passive range of motion there is some tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus and there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or clavicular joints and you have good hand grip bilaterally neurovascular exam of your left arm your cap refill is brisk in less than three seconds and motor and sensation is intact to light touch now for review of your x-ray of that left shoulder the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality so let me talk to you briefly about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy this means that the tendons of the muscles of that left shoulder have been injured and the injury happened to the tendons that make up or attach to the shoulder muscles i'm gon na go ahead and order an mri of your shoulder just to make sure nothing else is going on with that left shoulder i'm also going to go ahead and refer you for physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks okay now during that time i want you to continue to take tylenol p.r.n . if your symptoms do n't improve we can then consider maybe like a steroid injection of that left shoulder which could hopefully get you some relief now do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
[patient] yeah so i'm really active so do you think that this pain will ever go away
[doctor] i do i do believe that that pain is gon na go away many of my patients are successful with pt so we are gon na start with that take a conservative approach and see how you do
[patient] okay alright
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you some paperwork and i'll see you in about two about two weeks

[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast
[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible
[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri
[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon

[patient] lucken it up
[doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain
[patient] no i feel like taking the medicine
[doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet
[patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals
[doctor] alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] eleven out of ten
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident
[patient] yeah the whole foot is numb
[doctor] okay
[patient] but been now for a long time
[doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that
[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast
[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible
[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri
[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon
[patient] can i think about it and we have some time

"[doctor] hey george how are you today i understand you're here for some numbness and tingling in your fingers and some pain in your wrist
[patient] right my right wrist and hand has been bothering me probably for a few months now with pain and numbness
[doctor] okay and you said that's been ongoing for several months do you know what caused this type of pain or is it just something that started slowly or
[patient] it just kinda started on it's own it i notice it mostly at night
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes it will i'll wake up and my hands asleep and i got ta shake it out
[doctor] shake it out and okay
[patient] and then some
[doctor] what kind of work do you do
[patient] i do yard work
[doctor] yard work
[patient] landscaping landscaping
[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out
[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand
[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left
[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that
[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips
[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side
[patient] yeah same thing
[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start

[doctor] shake it out and okay
[patient] and then some
[doctor] what kind of work do you do
[patient] i do yard work
[doctor] yard work
[patient] landscaping landscaping
[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out
[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand
[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left
[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that
[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips
[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side
[patient] yeah same thing
[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start

[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know i like to eat right
[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months

[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain
[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease
[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off

[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack

[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago

"[doctor] hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient
[patient] and i'm your patient yeah
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control
[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you
[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there
[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine
[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists
[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten
[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten
[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad
[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away
[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you
[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way
[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that
[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines
[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past
[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past
[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they
[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of
[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right
[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well
[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass
[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out
[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend
[patient] just getting this pain under control
[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] no no no pain
[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer
[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing
[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to

"[doctor] hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient
[patient] and i'm your patient yeah
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control
[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you
[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there
[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine
[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists
[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten
[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten
[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad
[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away
[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you
[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way
[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that
[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines
[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past
[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past
[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they
[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of
[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right
[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well
[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass
[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out
[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend
[patient] just getting this pain under control
[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] no no no pain
[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer
[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing
[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to
[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want
[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me
[patient] no i'm friend
[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good

[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah

It is exacerbated by bending over and lifting heavy objects, but it can occur randomly. The patient denies any changes in bowel or bladder function. He states that his wife often tells him to stretch to relieve his pain, and this usually works. The patient states that he tried icing and pain medications without relief. He currently takes ibuprofen 800 mg daily. On physical examination, the patient experiences pain with flexion, extension, and weightbearing. There is no pain with palpation to the right side, but there is pain with palpation to the left side around L5.","SUBJECTIVE

[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions

[doctor] okay . all right . um , but , ha- ha- have you ... let's just talk about your review of systems . have you had any dizziness , lightheadedness , fever , chills ?
[patient] running up and down the stairs , it was pretty warm , so i did feel a little bit lightheaded , and i did get a little dizzy , but i thought it was just the heat and the fatigue .
[doctor] okay . any chest pain , shortness of breath , or belly pain ?
[patient] shortness of breath . no belly pain though .
[doctor] okay . all right . and , how about any joint pain or muscle aches ?
[patient] uh , my knees hurt a little bit from running up and down , and maybe picking up the boxes , but nothing out of the ordinary .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , and , in terms of your asthma , you just said that you were short of breath running up and down the stairs , so , um , do , how often have you been using your inhaler over the past year ?
[patient] only when it seems to go over about 85 degrees out . that's when i really feel it , so that's when i've been using it . if it's a nice , cool , dry day , i really do n't use the inhaler .
[doctor] okay . and , um-
[doctor] and , in terms of your activities of daily living , are you able to exercise or anything like-
[patient] yes , i do exercise in the morning . i , i ride , uh , our bike for probably about 45 minutes or so .
[doctor] okay . all right . and then , your depression , you said it's ... how's that going ? i know we have you on the , on the prozac 20mg a day . are you taking that ? are you having a lot of side effects from that ?
[patient] i was taking it regularly , but i've kind of weened myself off of it . i thought i felt a little bit better , but i think , uh , i , i kinda go through battles with depression every so often .
[doctor] okay . all right . are you interested in resuming the medication , or would you like to try a different one ?
[patient] i , maybe adjusting what i'm currently taking , maybe l- less of a dose so i do n't feel the side effects as much , but i , i'm willing to try something different .
[doctor] okay . all right . okay , well , let's , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you're in , in no apparent distress . i'm feeling your neck . there's no cervical lymphadenopathy . your thyroid seems not enlarged . and , listening to your lungs , you do have some bilateral expiratory wheezing that's very faint , and your heart is a regular rate and rhythm . your abdomen is soft , and uh , your lower extremities have no edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the pfts .
[doctor] okay , so your , your pfts , that , those are your breathing studies , and those look quite good , so i know that you're wheezing right now , but , um , you know , i think that we can add , add , um , a regimen to that to help , to help you with your , um , exacerbations during the , the summer months , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , let's look at your ... hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so your a1c , you're right , you know , over the past couple months is , you know , your blood sugar's probably been running a little high , so , you know , i know that you're gon na get back on your diet regimen , but , um , for right now , let's go ahead and we'll increase your metformin , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then , hey , dragon ? show me the chest x-ray . okay , good , and your chest x-ray looks fine , so we know that there's no pneumonia there .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and , it's just is all just from your asthma . so , you know , my impression of you at this time , you know , from a diabetes standpoint , let's , let's increase the metformin to 1,000 mg twice a day . um , and , we will get a repeat hemoglobin a1c in three months , and i want you to continue to monitor your blood sugars at home .
[doctor] from an asthma standpoint , let's continue you on the albuterol , two puffs , uh , every four to six hours as needed , and we'll add symbicort , two puffs twice a day during the summer , to kind of help prevent those exacerbations . and then , from a depression standpoint , we'll go ahead and start you on a different medication , zoloft , um , 25 mg once a day and see how you tolerate that . does that sound okay ?
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right . so , the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you situated with all of that , okay ?
[patient] great .
[doctor] it was good to see you .

1. Heart Failure Exacerbation
Assessment: The patient presented with shortness of breath, which resolved spontaneously within a few hours. He also has a history of heart failure and is currently compliant with his medications. His blood pressure is elevated today, suggesting possible decompensation of his CHF. Physical exam revealed mild lower extremity edema, crackles on lung exam, and supple neck. ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Echo showed normal LVEF. Differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or PE. However, given his negative troponin and unchanged EKG, ACS is less likely. CXR is not suggestive of PE.
Plan:
- Will start Lasix 80mg QD.
- Will start Carvedilol 25mg BID.
- Adjust medications if needed based on response.
2. Hypertension
Assessment: The patient's blood pressure is elevated today. He has a history of HTN.

[patient] it's been okay . it's been a lot of long hours , late nights . a lot of , um , you know , fiscal year end data that i've been having to pull . so , a lot of responsibility , which is good . but with the responsibility comes the stress .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year . it showed that you have that low-ish pumping function of your heart at about 45 % . and it also sh- shows some mitral regurgitation , that's that heart murmur that i heard , okay ?
[doctor] um , hey , dragon , show me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day , just because your blood pressure's high . and you know , you are retaining a little bit of fluid . i also wan na start you on some lasix , you know , 20 milligrams a day . and have you continue to watch your , your diet , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i also wan na repeat another echocardiogram , okay ?
[patient] all right .

[patient] no , i feel the same way .
[doctor] okay , all right . and then for your last problem your hypertension , you know , again i , i , i think it's out of control . but we'll see , i think , you know , i'd like to see you take the lisinopril as directed , okay ? uh , i want you to record your blood pressures within the patient , you know , take your blood pressure every day . record them to me for like , about a week , so i have to see if we have to add another agent , okay ? 'cause we need to get that under better control for your heart failure to be more successful , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] do you have any questions ? , and i forgot . for your annual exam , you're due for a mammogram , so we have to schedule for that , as well , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . do you have any questions ?
[patient] can i take all my pills at the same time ?
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] 'cause i've been trying to take them at different times of the day , 'cause i did n't know if it was bad to take them all at once or i should separate them . i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah . you can certainly take them , you know , all at the same time , as long , as yeah , they're all one scale . you can take them all at the same time . just set an alarm-
[patient] okay .
[doctor] . some time during the day to take them , okay ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ? hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram . so , this is the result of the echocardiogram that we did last year . it showed that you have that low-ish pumping function of your heart at about 45 % . and it also sh- shows some mitral regurgitation , that's that heart murmur that i heard , okay ?
[doctor] um , hey , dragon , show me the lipid panel . so , looking at your lipid panel from last year , you know , everything , your cholesterol was like , a tiny bit high . but it was n't too , too bad , so i know you're trying to watch your diet . so , we'll repeat another one this year , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you , okay ? so , for your first problem your congestive heart failure , um , i wan na continue you on your current medications . but i do wan na increase your lisinopril to 40 milligrams a day , just because your blood pressure's high . and you know , you are retaining a little bit of fluid . i also wan na start you on some lasix , you know , 20 milligrams a day . and have you continue to watch your , your diet , okay ?

[patient] no , i feel the same way .
[doctor] okay , all right . and then for your last problem your hypertension , you know , again i , i , i think it's out of control . but we'll see , i think , you know , i'd like to see you take the lisinopril as directed , okay ? uh , i want you to record your blood pressures within the patient , you know , take your blood pressure every day . record them to me for like , about a week , so i have to see if we have to add another agent , okay ?

[patient] can i take all my pills at the same time ?

[doctor] okay and are you waking up at night to go to the bathroom does it impact your sleep
[patient] yeah i try to empty my bladder now right before i go to bed and and not drink anything but i'm still probably getting up three or four times a night to go to the bed
[doctor] okay so you're getting up about three or four times a night and and how long has this been going on you said for about six months
[patient] yeah six months to like this and it's probably been a little bit worse over the last six months and maybe it's been longer i just did n't want to bring it up

[patient] yeah so sounds good have you seen that commercial for that super batter prostate stuff does that work
[doctor] well i think the data it's it's i'm not really sure if it works or not i'm not that familiar with it let's just go ahead and stick with flomax and that's why we are gon na refer you to the urologist so that they can go ahead and talk to you about you know the most current treatment options for you okay
[patient] alright
[doctor] alright for your second problem of your coronary artery disease i wan na go ahead and order an echocardiogram just to follow up on that heart murmur that you had and i wan na go ahead and continue you on the lipitor forty milligrams a day and the aspirin and the metoprolol and i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel any questions about that
[patient] nope
[doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your diabetes it sounds like you're doing really well let's go ahead and continue you on the metformin a thousand milligrams twice a day we will go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to that and i'm gon na see you again in about three to four weeks okay i want you to call me or message me in the patient portal if you have any concerns

[patient] no

[patient] nothing no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt

[patient] no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .

[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] okay . and how often are you getting it ?
[patient] um , probably about three- three times a week .
[doctor] okay , all right . well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure . um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ?
[patient] no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .
[doctor] okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard before . your lungs are nice and clear , uh , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits , and- and you have no lower extremity edema , you have healed , uh , surgical scars on your- on your , uh , right wrist . um , so let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ? so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard . hey dragon , show me the ecg ? and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease . there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you .
[doctor] so , from your first problem , you know , your carpal tunnel release , i do n't think that we need to anything further about that , 'cause you seem to be doing really well , you're back at work , if you have any recurring symptoms , just let me know , and we can take it from there . for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time . so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know . and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have .
[doctor] so , i wan na go ahead and continue you on your asprin , and your toprol , okay ? i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm gon na go ahead and get a lipid panel and , uh , start you on crestor 20 mg , once a day , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , order a cardiac stress test . do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . hey dragon , finalize the note . so , it was good to see you , the nurse will come in , she'll help you get your scheduled for all of those things , and i'll be in touch , okay ?
[patient] okay .

[patient] it's been okay . um , i have n't been smoking . i ... after i quit , i quit cold turkey and i have n't gone back since . so , that's been doing well . i think , uh , during the changes of season , it gets a little bit harder for me to breathe , but i think that's just because of my allergies .
[doctor] okay . all right . and then from a congestive heart failure standpoint , are you watching your diet , you're watching your salt intake ?
[patient] yeah . i've been doing really well with that . i've been staying away from the french fries , and all the other salty foods that i love to eat , uh , and everything looks great .

[doctor] that can certainly cause your blood sugar to be elevated . um , hey dragon , uh , show me the rapid strep . and you also have , uh , positive for strep . so i think we have some reasons as to why your blood sugar is so high . so my impression of you , you know , you have this hyperglycemia , which is probably related to some infections going on in your body . um , from a- a- a rapid strep standpoint we're gon na go ahead and treat you with penicillin or , i'm sorry , amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day . uh , make sure you take it all , even if you start feeling better , okay ?
[patient] for sure .
[doctor] hey dragon , order amoxicillin , 500 milligrams , three times a day for 10 days . um ... okay . and from ... , and from all- ... a positive lyme titer aspect , we should go ahead and order a western blot , just pcr to see if you have any , um , to see if it's actually acute lyme , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . um , hey dragon , order a western blot pcr for lyme . okay . all right . well we'll go ahead and , um , the nurse will come in soon and she'll set you up with these tests , okay ?

"[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

[doctor] well i'm glad that you're taking the first steps to quit smoking would you tell me a little bit more about your history of smoking
[patient] yeah so i've been smoking for some time now i started in high school and was just you know just experimenting and smoking here and there with friends or at parties and then it just started getting more regular and regular and i do n't even know how i'm 44 now and i'm smoking everyday so yes now i'm up to a pack and a half a day
[doctor] okay do you use any other type of tobacco products
[patient] no smoking is enough
[doctor] okay and i understand that so when you wake up in the morning how soon after waking up do you smoke your first cigarette
[patient] i would say probably within an hour of waking up i'll have my first cigarette
[doctor] okay so i'm really excited that you wan na quit and i know that you probably heard this multiple times before but this really is one of the best things that you can do to help your health especially since you have the history of gout and type two diabetes this is really gon na be a great step in you having better long term health outcomes
[patient] yeah i know and you know i'm really motivated now because i am about to be a father any day now and i just really wan na be there for my daughter growing up

[doctor] okay alright that sounds good well congratulations again i'm very excited for you and your and and your wife that that's this is great
[patient] thank you
[doctor] so you mentioned you tried to quit before can you tell me a little bit about the methods that you used or or what you tried
[patient] yeah actually i just went cold turkey one day i woke up and i said you know i've had enough and i know that smoking is not good for me so i woke up and stopped and i actually did really well and i was able to quit smoking for almost a year and then things just started getting really stressful at work they started laying people off and i'm happy i still have a job but that also meant that i was responsible for more things so things just got stressful and i and just started picking it up again

[doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me
[patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing
[doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards
[patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing
[doctor] not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay
[patient] alright alright sounds good

[doctor] hello , are you mrs. king ?
[patient] i am .
[doctor] i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] how can i help you today ?
[patient] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

[doctor] okay okay and okay and yeah that does sound unusual for you and so it's been high but you've also felt lightheaded at times have you checked your blood pressure when you were feeling lightheaded was it was it low at those times or have you done that
[patient] i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side
[doctor] okay alright understood and you have n't passed out or anything have you
[patient] not recently
[doctor] okay and have you had any chest pain or trouble breathing along with you know your elevated blood pressure
[patient] sometimes a little heaviness in my chest but no no nothing sustained and i do n't have any respiratory or breathing difficulty
[doctor] okay excellent and how about any headaches or other neurologic symptoms like numbness or weakness or you know balance instability or anything like that
[patient] little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher
[doctor] okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what
[patient] just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded
[doctor] okay alright understood and you've not had any any fever or nausea vomiting anything like that have you or diarrhea
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and are you feeling any palpitations or your heart racing anything unusual there
[patient] not usually no
[doctor] okay and are you still taking the lisinopril twenty milligrams once per day no actually i see we last visit we increased that to twice per day you're still taking that lisinopril twenty milligrams twice per day
[patient] yes i am
[doctor] okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance
[patient] very rarely
[doctor] okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that
[patient] yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately
[doctor] that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go
[patient] they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time
[doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still
[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day
[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound
[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things
[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me

"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .",ap,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?

"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .

"[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

"[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .

"[doctor] next patient is paul edwards , date of birth is january 15th 1962 . so he's a 59 year old hiv positive gentleman here for hypogonadism . patient was last seen on november 24th 2020 . his notable things are number one , he is on 1 milliliter every 10 days , uh , his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he's on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily so he takes all his pills just from me . um , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia which is ... which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1,500 .
[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .

[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .
[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .
[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?
[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .
[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?
[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .
[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?
[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .
[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?
[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .
[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?
[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .
[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
[patient] mother's .
[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
[patient] i own an auto repair shop .
[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .
[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .
[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
[patient] okay , that's fine .
[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .

[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too

"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .
[doctor] all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .
[doctor] let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
[doctor] mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice .
[doctor] gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 .
[doctor] cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow from no- finger to nose . of note , the ct scan from the head of 10/15/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of monro of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters . by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection . this was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated any extra axial fluid collections . there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change .

[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .
[doctor] all righty , so ros is constitutional significant for impaired ability to carry out daily functions . negative for fever or unintentional weight loss . gu is significant for urinary incontinence and wearing a diaper . negative for genital sores , decreased or painful output . neurological significant for continued walking impairment and cognitive impairment . negative for headaches , recent falls , or hallucinations . psychiatric is negative for depression , excessive worrying , or mood swings .
[doctor] let's go ahead and use the short pe . vitals , let's see , blood pressure is 124/80 , heart rate 64 , respirations 18 , weight 174 pounds , and pain zero out of 10 .
[doctor] mr . watson is a pleasant and cooperative man who's able to converse easily through , um , though his daughter does add some details . the shunt sight was clean , dry , and intact with a confirmed setting of two . um he was tested um for recent and remote memory , attention span , and concentration in fund of knowledge . he scored a 26 out of 30 on the mmse when tested with spelling and 25 out of 30 when tested with calculations . of note , he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing , and the third with multiple choice . this was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23 out of 30 with calculations and 24 out of 30 with spelling . and at the time he was unable um in the previous test , excuse me , he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing without and only one with multiple choice .
[doctor] gait testing using the tinetti assessment tool . he was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of six to eight out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28 . this is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28 .
[doctor] cranial nerves , pupils are equal . eoms are intact . face symmetric . no disarchria . motor normal for bulk and strength . coordination slow from no- finger to nose . of note , the ct scan from the head of 10/15/2020 shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of monro of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters . by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection . this was not noticed or noted by the radiologist who stated any extra axial fluid collections . there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change .
[doctor] diagnosis adult hydrocephalus , gait impairment , urinary incontinence and urgency , and cognitive impairment .",ap,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Adult hydrocephalus 
Assessment: The patient presents with progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. He underwent shunt surgery on August 1st, 2020, and has shown improvement since then. However, he continues to experience urinary incontinence and urgency. Clinically, he has a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Monroe of 4.6 centimeters with a third ventricular contour that is flat with a span of 10 millimeters. There is also a tiny amount of blood in the right front region with a tiny subdermal collection. 
Plan: 
- Will continue to monitor the patient's condition and perform regular checkups. 
- Consider referral to physical therapy for gait training. 
- Continue to encourage the patient to drink plenty of fluids to prevent further urinary incontinence. 
2. Gait impairment 
Assessment: The patient's gait was evaluated using the Tinetti Assessment Tool, which showed a gait score of 6 to 8 out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28. This is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28. 
Plan: 
- Will continue to monitor the patient's condition and perform regular checkups. 
- Consider referral to physical therapy for gait training. 

3. Urinary incontinence and urgency 
Assessment: The patient experiences urinary incontinence and urgency. His symptoms have not changed since his shunt surgery. 
Plan: 
- Will continue to monitor the patient's condition and perform regular checkups. 
- Recommend the patient to wear a diaper to manage his urinary incontinence. 
- Encourage the patient to drink plenty of fluids to prevent further urinary incontinence. 

Follow-up instructions: 
- Return to clinic in 3 months for repeat examination.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. Adult Hydrocephalus
Assessment: The patient has a history of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control for 8 to 10 years. He underwent shunt surgery on August 1, 2020, and has been doing well since then. His walking has improved, and he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine. However, he still has times where his daughter needs to help him. His bladder control did improve after surgery but has leveled off, and he is currently wearing diapers. Cognition has improved, and he feels like he can have a normal conversation with people again.
Plan:
- Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as needed.
- Recommend driving safety programs if the patient's movement speed improves to the level needed for passing the driver safety evaluation.
2. Gait Impairment
Assessment: The patient has a gait score of 6 to 8 out of 12 and a balance score of 12 out of 16 for a total score of 18 to 20 out of 28. This is slightly improved from his initial score of 15 to 17 out of 28.
Plan:
- Continue physical therapy exercises to improve gait function.
- Consider referral to occupational therapy for further assistance.
3. Urinary Incontinence and Urgency
Assessment: The patient has urinary incontinence and urgency, which is likely due to his adult hydrocephalus.
Plan:
- Monitor the patient's urine output and frequency.
- Consider medication or other treatments if necessary.
4. Cognitive Impairment
Assessment: The patient has cognitive impairment, which is likely due to his adult hydrocephalus.
Plan:
- Continue monitoring the patient's cognitive function and adjust treatment as needed.
Follow-up instructions:
- Follow up with the doctor in 3 months to discuss the results of the ct scan and to determine if the patient is ready to start driving again.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-
[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .
[doctor] not because of it . okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i see what you're saying .

[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .

[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .

[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .

1. Bilateral Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
Assessment: Patient presents with numbness, tingling, and weakness in both hands, extending from the middle and ring fingers to the palmar surface of the forearm. He has a history of car wreck last December, which resulted in right wrist injury. He also reports neck stiffness and head contusion. Physical examination reveals decreased sensation in third and fourth fingers on the right and fourth and fifth fingers on the left, and positive Tinel signs bilaterally.
Plan:
- Will order EMG test to determine exact location of nerve irritation.
- If symptoms persist, will refer to Hand Clinic for possible injections or carpal tunnel release surgery.
- Continue current medications for hypertension and anxiety.
- Encourage patient to continue splint use and maintain proper posture while working.

Follow-up instructions:
- Return to clinic after EMG study results are available.","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1. Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) vs. bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome (CUTS):
Assessment: Patient presents with numbness, tingling, and weakness in his hands, particularly in the right hand. He has a history of car wreck last December, which caused injury to his right wrist. Examination reveals decreased pinprick sensation in third and fourth fingers on the right and fourth and fifth fingers on the left. Tinel signs are positive at both wrists and both elbows. The presentation suggests CTS. However, further testing with EMG is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Plan:
- Schedule patient for EMG test.
- If the results confirm CTS, plan to treat conservatively with splints and physical therapy. If the symptoms persist, will refer to hand clinic for possible injections or carpal tunnel release surgery.
- If the results suggest CUTS, will refer to orthopedics for further management.

2. Prediabetes:
Assessment: Patient reports that he had prediabetes, but he changed his diet and got it under control.
Plan:
- Continue monitoring blood sugar levels.

3. Hypertension:
Assessment: Patient continues to take Coreg for hypertension.

[doctor] hello , are you mr. allen ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] hi . my name is dr. edwards . nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you .
[doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] did you have any problems finding us ?
[patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before .
[doctor] good . so how can i help you today ? uh , the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea .
[patient] right . so i've had ... i've been having this pain right here in my stomach , like right around here .
[doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen , just below the belly button ?
[patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about two years . i finally went to the er and a ... a few months ago and they did a ct scan .
[doctor] i saw that .
[patient] yeah . they said they did n't really see anything on the scan .
[doctor] yes , i agree . it looked normal .
[patient] the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea .
[doctor] is the pain there all the time ?
[patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends . sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't .
[doctor] has this been the case over the past two years as well ?
[patient] more recently in the past couple months , at least with the constipation and diarrhea .
[doctor] and before that , how are your bowel movements ?
[patient] they were normal .
[doctor] uh , okay . so any blood in your stool ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ?
[patient] probably more constipation .
[doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ?
[patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard .
[doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ?
[patient] about three to four times a week . it's like when i need to go to the bathroom , if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go .
[doctor] okay . and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ?
[patient] yeah , it gets a little better .
[doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay ? any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ?
[patient] none of that .
[doctor] okay . so tell me about the diarrhea , how often do you get it ?
[patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach . if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce , i'm probably gon na have diarrhea .
[doctor] okay . and it does n't happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ?
[patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over .
[doctor] and how's your weight been ? any fluctuation ?
[patient] nice and pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ?
[patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even thought i've never been diagnosed with it .
[doctor] okay . and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ?
[patient] i've never had any surgery .
[doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all those are still intact ?
[patient] yup .
[doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ?
[patient] no . i thought that happen when you turn 50 .
[doctor] well , that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy , like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .
[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?
[doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so now , i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen . let me know if you have any pain .
[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .
[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?
[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .
[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?
[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .
[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?
[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .
[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?
[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .
[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?
[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .
[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?
[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .
[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .
[patient] what would cause that ?
[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .
[patient] that's good .
[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .
[patient] what's that ?
[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .
[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?
[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .
[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?
[doctor] correct .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .
[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?
[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .
[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?
[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .
[patient] so what do i need to do ?
[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .
[patient] okay . and then what ?
[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .
[patient] which medications ?
[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?
[patient] about 18 months .
[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .
[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?
[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .
[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .
[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .
[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?
[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .
[patient] okay . and then what happens ?
[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .
[patient] and when should i see you again ?
[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .
[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?
[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .
[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .
[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .
[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .

[doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it
[patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure
[doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place

[doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now
[patient] nothing right now
[doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going
[patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose
[doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you
[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright any other questions we got
[patient] that's it

[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well

[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes
[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me

[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?

[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !

[patient] no other issues .
[doctor] okay . great . let's do the exam . all right , so your physical exam looks pretty normal other than you've got kind of these mild wheezes in all your lung fields . and so i think you do have copd from your pulmonary function tests , your x-ray , and that . so i'm gon na diagnose you with copd . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . it means you're not able to exhale appropriately .

[doctor] let's look at our x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the most recent x-ray . okay , i said it wrong . hey , dragon , show me the most recent chest x-ray . okay , this is interesting . your ... kind of your diaphragm is a little bit flatter , and we'll see that in some , uh , copd , which happens with smokers often . so let's just do a quick physical exam . i know my nurse did the review of systems with you . is there anything else bothering you that we need to talk about today ?
[patient] no other issues .
[doctor] okay . great . let's do the exam . all right , so your physical exam looks pretty normal other than you've got kind of these mild wheezes in all your lung fields . and so i think you do have copd from your pulmonary function tests , your x-ray , and that . so i'm gon na diagnose you with copd . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . it means you're not able to exhale appropriately .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so we're gon na put you on a medicine called combivent . okay , you're gon na do two puffs twice a day . it's gon na help open up your lungs . it's an inhaler .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , order combivent , uh , two puffs twice a day . order albuterol , two puffs as needed . and order , uh , prednisone uh taper pack . okay , so and then it sounds like your depression's stable , so we're not gon na change anything . you're gon na keep taking the effexor . um , do yoga for depression and your back pain , so for your back pain , stay on the neurontin , and we just wo n't do anything different . any questions for me .

"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , "" fds tendon , "" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .
[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .
[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?
[patient] i'm good , how about you ?
[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?
[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .
[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?
[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .
[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?
[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .
[doctor] yeah , i see that .
[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .
[doctor] what do you do for a living ?
[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .
[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?
[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .
[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?
[patient] uh , that's correct .
[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .
[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?
[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .
[doctor] all right , how about here ?
[patient] um , there , it's not .
[doctor] okay , not as bad ?
[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .
[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .
[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .
[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?
[patient] ow , .
[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .
[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .
[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .
[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .
[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .
[patient] so the good one is good ?
[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .
[patient] okay , all right .
[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .
[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .
[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .
[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .
[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .
[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .
[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .
[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...
[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?
[patient] uh , not at the moment .
[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .
[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?
[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .
[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .
[patient] thanks , doc .
[doctor] right trigger finger injection template . attempted to inject one cc of celestone with f- , a half a cc of lidocaine . however , the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle , with contortions of the hand , and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with one cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . a small parma- , uh , palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing in it this evening , and taking ibuprofen .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

Evaluation of right index finger.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
The patient is a pleasant, cooperative, healthy male who presents to the clinic for evaluation of his right index finger. He reports that he sustained a hyperextension injury of the right index finger during a motor vehicle accident in March of this year. He declined an injection of A1 poly region due to a previous reaction to dexamethasone, which caused him to experience heart racing. The patient underwent MRI of the right index finger on April 24, 2021, which showed a partially torn fds tendon and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fds and FDP tendons. He has been seen at Point May Orthopedics, where he received X-rays of the right hand today, which revealed no bony abnormalities, joint congruency throughout all lesser digits, no soft tissue shadows of concern, and no arthritis. The patient reported that while he can bend the finger, he cannot make a fist without experiencing significant discomfort.

Second opinion regarding right index finger injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
The patient is a 50-year-old male who presents for a second opinion regarding his right index finger injury. He sustained the injury in a motor vehicle accident in March, and he was initially evaluated by Dr. Alice Davis. An MRI of the right index finger was performed due to concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendons. The MRI showed focal soft tissue swelling over the right index metacarpophalangeal joint, partial-thickness tear of the FDS tendon, and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the FDP and FDS tendons. Radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index metacarpophalangeal joint were intact, and the joint capsule was intact. Extensor tendons were also deemed intact.

"[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .

"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .",sub,"SUBJECTIVE

"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .",ap,"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy

[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions

"[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
[doctor] no i do n't do that
[patient] okay
[doctor] none of us do
[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us
[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
[doctor] yeah i'm okay
[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies
[patient] okay and do you smoke
[doctor] i do n't smoke
[patient] do you live with anybody who does
[doctor] i do not
[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[doctor] okay it does
[patient] alright
[doctor] thank you
[patient] okay no problem

[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[doctor] okay it does
[patient] alright
[doctor] thank you
[patient] okay no problem

[patient] maybe like two weeks ago
[doctor] okay and which knee are we talking about
[patient] my right knee
[doctor] alright and tell me exactly what happened so we were like riding together and i think he said he saw a squirrel or something like that he's a little distractible and you know like he went down so i went down i hit it on the curb like it's really kinda it was sore i gave i i took some ibuprofen and i i like washed it out and put a band-aid on it but it's it's just been like kind of hurting everyday since then so i scheduled an appointment
[patient] okay is it getting better getting worse or just kinda lingering on
[doctor] it's it's just holding on and i tried taking like medication right i took some ibuprofen and it was fine it just like it keeps coming back and i i read on the label i'm not supposed to take that stuff for more than two weeks right
[patient] well it all it all depends everyone's different we'll get to that
[doctor] okay
[patient] and your knee was not bothering you at all before this normal knee
[doctor] yep
[patient] never okay alright what do you do for living
[doctor] well i work in a children's hospital so i like play around i i'm a i'm a a baby rocker professionally i go into like the nicu's and i i rock some of the babies
[patient] gotcha what do you do outside of outside of work is biking kinda your thing
[doctor] no that was his thing and i think that's why we fell i i should n't trust him but most of the time i go on walks with my dog
[patient] okay have you broke up with him already or
[doctor] no i did n't know that knee injury was a reason to but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that
[patient] we'll talk about that later too
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here
[doctor] okay
[patient] you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright then
[doctor] i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here
[patient] is this where it hurts
[doctor] yeah like when you touch it it really hurts
[patient] right there okay tell me what's worse here or here
[doctor] on the inside
[patient] okay so medial joint line tenderness
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here
[doctor] no i do n't think so
[patient] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side
[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks
[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it
[doctor] all the way back
[patient] okay let's see
[doctor] okay
[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too
[doctor] yeah that's fine
[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax
[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee
[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
[doctor] okay
[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
[doctor] yeah sometimes
[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] you actually no
[doctor] yeah it hurts no
[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak
[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls

[patient] okay do do you wear clips or are you just wearing a regular shoe and on a regular pedal
[doctor] i'm on a regular shoe some most of the time i'm in my flip flops
[patient] okay okay the how is there anything that you were doing out of the ordinary when this started
[doctor] no i do n't that's the thing i do n't remember an injury if it was something that i injured i think i would have just ignored it and would n't have showed up here but when it got red and warm to touch that's when i i was really concerned
[patient] okay do does even light pressure to it bother it like at night when you're laying in bed do the sheets bother
[doctor] absolutely i was just gon na say when i'm in bed at night and those sheets come down on it or i roll over yeah that hurts a lot
[patient] okay have you done anything to try to get it to feel better any soaks or taking any medicine
[doctor] i take you know like a two ibuprofen a day and that does n't seem to help
[patient] okay
[doctor] alrighty
[patient] let me see your your foot here and let me take your big toe through a range of motion if i push your top to bottom
[doctor] yeah ouch
[patient] big toe joint that okay and let me move it up where as i bend it up does that hurt
[doctor] it hurts but not as much as when you moved it down
[patient] okay so i'm moving it down here and it i've got about ten degrees of plantar flexion does that hurt
[doctor] yeah it a little when you take it a little further
[patient] if i go a little bit further to twenty degrees does that hurt
[doctor] that hurts more yeah
[patient] okay if i push in on your big toe and move it back and forth does that hurt
[doctor] yes it does and it it's almost like those joints that when you push it back it's almost like it's grinding a little bit too
[patient] okay if i push in between your big toe and your second toe here does that hurt
[doctor] a little bit but not terrible
[patient] okay what about if i push on the other side here
[doctor] yeah yeah right there on the outside of it absolutely
[patient] okay
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay and i'm feeling a little bit of bone spur here as well let me let me get an x-ray
[doctor] okay
[patient] and after we take a peek at that we'll develop a plan
[doctor] okay
[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back
[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in
[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint
[doctor] oh
[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage
[doctor] oh
[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach
[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach
[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there
[doctor] yeah
[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call
[doctor] okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot
[doctor] okay
[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes
[doctor] is that surgery
[patient] i have to
[doctor] would that be
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint
[patient] yeah that would
[doctor] okay
[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer
[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done
[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks

[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike

[doctor] hey , dragon ? order metformin , 500 milligrams , twice a day . and then if some of the autoimmune labs that come back show that you have an autoimmune disorder , meaning that you would have type i diabetes , then we would have to go ahead and put you on insulin . but i'm gon na hold off until we have those results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in the meantime , i really want you to avoid , uh , foods high in sugar . um , and the , the nurse will come in and she'll give you a glucometer and teach you how to do blood sugar testing . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , from an atrial fibrillation standpoint , your heart , even though you're in atrial fibrillation right now , is in a good rate . and we'll just continue you on your metoprolol , 25 milligrams , twice a day . do you need a refill on that ?
[patient] yes , i do .
